# change request

Alex,

Please add the following features to this package:

1) A usage file that describes the gist of what this package does, how to run it, and how to functionally use it
2) Start using some sort of dependency/package manager (talk to Cooper about this, I believe he has one in mind that works well for python)
3) Allow it to be used in commandline supplying an argument to specify input path/filename

Let me know when you've added these.
Thanks!

TG
